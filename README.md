## Project Overview

This section covers all necessary technologies used for the program, as well as a "how to play" guide.

## To Play

* Please first create an account and confirm you are of the right age.
* Once account is created you will be logged into the game straight away.
* Click on the coin to start playing. Player 1 acts first, player 2 second.
* Once the coin moves to either div 1 or div 7, the appropriate player wins
* Congratulations losing player! Have a drink :)

## Technologies used 

* React.js as the front end library for JavaScript.
* Firebase as a backend database. This is used for user authentication + Deployment + Trivia in the firestore.

### To Do
1. Main goal is to get a multiplayer game running through Firebase. This can be achieved through coding rooms where players can create a room, then a unique code is shared with a friend.
2. User ability to decide on how long they want the gave divs to be. Currently there are 7, however can have 5, 9 etc.
3. Write a second game which is a button masher. The shotglass to move based on how many times PlayerCounter1 is ahead of PlayerCounter2.
4. Implement a backend database with random 'drink' trivia. - Completed
